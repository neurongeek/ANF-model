# ANF-model
This is a code for a model of auditory nerve responses. The model has been described in detail in Joshi et al. (2017)(https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10162-016-0608-2) and can be used to simulates spike times of the auditory nerve fibers in response to electrical stimulation with cochlear implants.
